# React boilerplate

A custom React project boilerplate

### Why another React boilerplate

Not only can I understand the React development environment better by creating one for myself, testing best practice I favour but also have a fast and clean start point to fire up personal projects.

### Motivation

I want to play around with React more on disposable projects. Create-react-app is great but it's missing some key features.

## Getting Started

Fork or download then run `npm install`.

## Built With

* React via [facebookincubator](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
* Redux
* BootStrap 4
* Sass

## Develop With

* [Presentational and container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
* [Constant Redux action types](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html#reducing-boilerplate)
* [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)

## Contributing

By me for me but help is always welcome!
