ðŸ¤–:bulb: A coaching chat-bot experiment

## Intro

This is a first attempt to build a chat bot from scratch using a json
schema as dialog stream. The UI is predominately Button based with
additional free text input to generate documents stored using firebase.

### Brief

Originally intended as a tool for publishing day to day learning
related to my role as a Creative Technologist. This chat-bot was the
interactive CMS to a micro blog.

### Outcome

While all the functionality is complected to an MVP standard (including
an integrated database service) I don't feel like its the best way to
compile and publish content.

### Next steps

I believe the blog that would accompany this chat bot could be an
interactive and be a faster, cleaner experience to use and so will
be focus of my attention going forward.
